- 👋 Hey there! I’m @KING-YAMA-2110, a Mechanical Engineer with a passion that’s anything but conventional. While my peers are engrossed in gears and thermodynamics, you’ll find me deep in the world of algorithms, circuits, and codes. Yep, I’m the black sheep of the Mech Engg flock, and I love it!

- 👀 My interests span across the fascinating realms of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Artificial Intelligence. I believe the future belongs to the machines (and the humans who understand them!). But wait, there's more! Robotics and electronics are close companions in my journey, as I strive to build smart machines that can shape the future. App development and competitive programming are my playgrounds for honing problem-solving skills and creating cool tech solutions.

- 🌱 Currently, I’m diving into Natural Language Processing (NLP), where I’m learning how to teach machines to understand and process human languages. It’s an incredible feeling to see machines decode sentences, understand context, and even generate text. From speech recognition to chatbot building, the possibilities are endless, and I’m ready to explore them all.

- 💞️ When it comes to collaboration, I’m an open book. Whether it’s a challenging AI project, an exciting robotics build, or even a coding marathon, I’m always game. If it involves learning new skills or solving complex problems, count me in. I believe in the power of collaboration—there’s so much we can learn from each other, and I’m here for it! So, if you’ve got a project or an idea brewing, hit me up—I’m your go-to person for fresh ideas, technical insights, and a passion for innovation.
